Drowsiness is a leading cause of road accidents, which often result in traffic congestion, property damage, and even loss of life. This project introduces a real-time, non-intrusive driver drowsiness detection system aimed at enhancing road safety and minimizing traffic disruptions. The system leverages an advanced object detection model to analyze a driver's facial expressions, focusing on identifying key indicators of drowsiness such as yawning, eye closure, and head movement. The model classifies these behaviors into three categories: normal, yawning, and sleep.

Once the system detects signs of drowsiness, particularly when the driver is falling asleep, an integrated alert mechanism is activated to immediately wake the driver. This warning system plays a critical role in preventing accidents caused by driver drowsiness , ensuring that drivers remain alert and attentive.

The proposed solution is designed for real-time performance, capable of running efficiently in various lighting conditions and environments. By reducing accidents related to drowsiness, this system not only improves road safety but also supports the broader goals of reducing traffic congestion and contributing to the efficiency of transportation networks.
